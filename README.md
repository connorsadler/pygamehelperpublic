# pygamehelper
Helper library for pygame, to manage your game in the background and let you concentrate on coding the sprites and game logic (just like you do in Scratch!)


## Features
- Maintains a list of sprites, which get moved and drawn by a standard function
- Easy to create your own sprite classes, create instances of them and add them to the sprites list
- Easy to tell sprites to die, and they get removed from the internal list of sprites
- Functions for sprites bouncing off the sides of the screen
- Functions for sprites colliding with each other
- Allows you to use an image for a Sprite, and can easily rotate this image
- The game "infinite loop" is in a standard class
